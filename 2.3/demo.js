var _ = require("lodash"); // Loads in the library lodash

console.log(_.random(1,100));

/* 
    -lodash was installed using command "npm install lodash".
     This installed lodash into the local directory "node_modules"
     
    -nodemon was installed using command "npm install -g nodemon"
     This installed nodemon to the nodes globl library thing, managed by NPM.
     Idk too much about this atm.
     To use nodemon in cmd / terminal type "nodemon (FILENAME)"
     This will re-run the (FILENAME) everytime a saved change is made to (FILENAME).
